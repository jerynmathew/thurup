Tests for card ranking in 28/56 card game.

This test file verifies that the card ranking system correctly implements
the 28/56 game rules where:
- ALL cards use the same ranking: J (highest) > 9 > A > 10 > K > Q > 8 > 7 (lowest)
- Trump vs non-trump affects WHICH cards compete, not ranking within a suit
