    # Instead, simulate seat1 playing a non-follow after removing their ♠ to mimic a player not having lead suit
    # To force reveal, set session.hands[1] so it still has ♠ but we simulate they play a non-follow; that should trigger reveal
    # However the server enforces follow-suit; so for reveal we emulate a player who *had* the suit but attempted to play non-follow and server will reject.
    # The correct flow to test reveal-on-first-nonfollow requires a client that plays illegally. Since server rejects illegal plays, reveal occurs only when a player *had* lead suit but **intentionally** played other suit (some house rules reveal in that case).
    # Our implementation triggers reveal when a legal play is non-follow while the player had the suit -> but we reject such play.
    # For robust test, change the rule temporarily:
    # Instead, test ON_FIRST_TRUMP_PLAY behaviour which reveals when a trump is played.
