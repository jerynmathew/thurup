# E2E Testing Setup Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully set up Playwright E2E testing for the Thurup frontend application.

### Files Created

1. **`playwright.config.ts`**
   - Main Playwright configuration
   - Auto-starts dev server on `http://localhost:5173`
   - Configured for Chromium browser
   - CI-ready (retries, sequential execution)
   - HTML reporter for test results

2. **`tests/e2e/home-page.spec.ts`**
   - 6 tests covering home page functionality
   - Tests: page rendering, game creation, form validation, join modal, game mode selection, help content

3. **`tests/e2e/game-flow.spec.ts`**
   - 8 comprehensive tests for game workflows
   - Tests: full game flow, bot management, starting games, session persistence, bidding, card display, WebSocket updates

4. **`tests/e2e/README.md`**
   - Complete documentation for E2E testing
   - Running instructions, best practices, debugging guide
   - Common patterns and examples

### Package.json Scripts Added

```json
"test:e2e": "playwright test",
"test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
"test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug",
"test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed"
```

### Browser Installation

- ‚úÖ Chromium browser installed
- ‚úÖ FFMPEG for video recording
- ‚úÖ Headless shell for faster execution

## Running Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all E2E tests (headless)
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI mode (recommended for development)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug a specific test
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Run Specific Tests

```bash
# Run only home page tests
npx playwright test home-page

# Run specific test by name
npx playwright test --grep "can create a new game"

# Run in specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

## Test Coverage

### Home Page (`home-page.spec.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Page displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Create new game flow
- ‚úÖ Form validation
- ‚úÖ Join game modal
- ‚úÖ Game mode selection
- ‚úÖ Help/rules content

### Game Flow (`game-flow.spec.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Complete game creation and lobby
- ‚úÖ Add bot players
- ‚úÖ Start game with full lobby
- ‚úÖ Session persistence on refresh
- ‚úÖ Place bids when player's turn
- ‚úÖ Display player cards
- ‚úÖ Real-time state updates via WebSocket

## Next Steps

### Recommended Additional Tests

1. **Admin Panel** (`admin-page.spec.ts`)
   - Login authentication
   - Session management
   - Game history browsing
   - Database stats

2. **Full Game Playthrough** (`full-game.spec.ts`)
   - Complete bidding phase
   - Trump selection
   - Card playing
   - Scoring
   - Multiple rounds

3. **Multi-user Tests** (`multiplayer.spec.ts`)
   - Multiple users in same game
   - Real-time synchronization
   - Concurrent actions

4. **Navigation & Error Handling** (`navigation.spec.ts`)
   - 404 page
   - Invalid game codes
   - Network errors
   - Disconnection recovery

## Best Practices

1. **Use accessible selectors**: `getByRole`, `getByText`, `getByLabel`
2. **Proper waiting**: Always use `await expect().toBeVisible()`
3. **Independent tests**: Don't rely on previous test state
4. **Descriptive names**: Clearly describe expected behavior
5. **Handle async**: Always await promises

## Debugging

### Visual Debugging
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Step-through Debugging
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### View Test Report
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### View Trace on Failure
Traces are automatically captured on retry. View with:
```bash
npx playwright show-trace test-results/.../trace.zip
```

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are configured for CI with:
- Automatic retries (2x)
- Sequential execution (no flaky tests)
- HTML report generation
- Screenshot capture on failure

Example GitHub Actions:
```yaml
- name: Install Playwright
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps

- name: Run E2E tests
  run: npm run test:e2e

- name: Upload report
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```
